# Anomaly-detector-for-an-IDS
This repository contains an anomaly detector for an IDS which will be designed for  the CPS. We first analysed the KDD dataset used for a competition to build an intrusion detection system.
Anomaly detection was performed on 2 datasets; NSL-KDD and SWaT and design an anomaly-based IDS for the given CPS in the scenario.
The models I used for detection are Logistic Regression and Random Forest.
For further details check the report attached with the Colab code and model file.
